        "<b>Conversion Story John Eric Thorderson</b><p><p>Ravenna is one of my favorite cities in all of Italy. I have been there a couple of times and it is absolutely beautiful. Originally, Ravenna was the seat of the Roman Empire in the 5th century and then of Byzantine Italy until the 8th century. The city is known for having the finest collection of Byzantine mosaics in all of Italy. A mosaic is made by inlaying small pieces of variously colored material (like stone, tiles, or glass) to form pictures or patterns. Every mosaic picture is created with thousands of small “tile-like” pieces, each one a small square about the size of a thumbnail<p>My testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ is much like one of these wonderful mosaics. Each tile represents a spiritual experience or a gospel principle that I have come to know to be true. Each becomes an integral part, uniquely connected, of a beautiful work of art that has developed into my testimony.<p>Let me share just a few of my tiles so that it might become clearer to you. Initially my mosaic was very small and represented principles that I had learned in Primary, at home, or from family members. For example, we are all children of our Heavenly Father. Several of my mosaic tiles are related to prayer. When I was younger, I remember seeing my mother kneel down and pray without her being aware that I was nearby. I remember thinking that she must really believe in prayer if she prays alone and so I decided to pray more diligently. Likewise, I remember going with my teacher’s quorum to the church potato farm and my advisor asking us to kneel down and pray because we were in need of heavenly help. I recall thinking that he too must really believe that prayers can be answered and that stuck with me. <p>Other tiles relate to my experiences in reading and studying the Book of Mormon. The first time I read it I felt a strong assurance that it was true and that it was the word of God. I remember thinking as a young man that if it wasn’t true, where did it come from and who could have written it. Now that I have read it many, many times since then, I have become more and more certain of the veracity of the book. Likewise, I know that we have a living prophet on the earth and that he is a true messenger of God. I know that families like ours can be eternal.<p>These are just a few simple examples and there are hundreds and hundreds more. My personal mosaic art continues to expand as I continue to have new experiences and I learn new things. My testimony is much like this attached mosaic. It is centered on the Savior, Jesus Christ. I know he lives, that he is the Son of God, that he atoned for each one of us. He is our Shepherd.",
